# abwaves

Generate images with **ab**stract **waves**.

## Usage

Currently this repo does not provide any friendly instruction.

`--release` is recommended for significantly faster image generation. Example: `cargo run --example asahi`
No antialiasing implemented. I just generate super high resolution image then downsample it to get smooth edges.
